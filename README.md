# FrogGame
A two player game where the players compete to jump over each other. The Game uses chance and challenge by randomizing the players jump velocity each time they jump. To also make the game more intresting the player characters have added weight that can impact movement and make controlling more difficult. The first player to jump over the other four times wins the game. To add a little more competition you can now collect flies to increase your score and make the game more intresting.
